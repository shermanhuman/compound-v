# Review: review-output-clarity

YOLO review — no findings. All three changes verified:

1. **Check coverage table** — new section 2 with explicit 10-check template
2. **Skip-details rule** — upgraded from advisory to imperative decision rule
3. **Persistence before verdict** — sections reordered (4 → 5) so action menu is structurally last
